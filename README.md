# Installation & Setup

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Qt Creator (for UI development)
- Node.js & npm (for backend)
- MySQL Server (for database storage)

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andytrix/atm-cash-machine.git  
cd atm-cash-machine
```
**2. Setup the Database**

- Start your MySQL server.  
- Import the database schema:

```bash
mysql -u root -p < db_dump.sql
```
**3. Start the Backend Server**

```bash
cd backend  
npm install
npm install multer  
node server.js  
```
**4. Run the Qt Application**

- Open Qt Creator.
- Load the project file (.pro).
- Build and run the application.

# Database Schema

The system is structured into multiple tables:

- **customer:** Stores user details, including first name, last name, profile picture, and account creation date.
- **card:** Holds card-specific data, including debit, credit, and dual card types, PIN codes, status (active, locked, inactive), and expiry date.
- **card_account:** Links cards to accounts and defines whether the link is debit or credit.
- **account:** Tracks account balances, credit limits, and account creation date.
- **transaction:** Logs all ATM transactions, including withdrawals and deposits.
